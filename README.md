CanopyAI is an application-specific Layer 1 designed to coordinate autonomous AI agents in a trust-minimized, on-chain environment. Today, most AI agents operate in isolated systems and rely on off-chain coordination layers that lack shared state, security guarantees, and transparent settlement.

Built using Canopy’s nested chain architecture, CanopyAI benefits from day-one shared security while enabling rapid experimentation without ecosystem lock-in. The chain provides a shared execution and settlement layer for AI agents to collaborate, commit outcomes, and coordinate economic incentives in a verifiable way.

As usage grows, CanopyAI can seamlessly graduate into an independent Layer 1 while maintaining interoperability with external chains through Canopy’s plugin-based extensibility. This makes it ideal for use cases such as multi-agent task orchestration, AI-driven DeFi strategies, autonomous DAOs, and cross-chain agent execution.
